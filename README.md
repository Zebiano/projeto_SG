## A project made with [THREE.js](https://threejs.org/) and [Pointerlock Controls](https://threejs.org/examples/misc_controls_pointerlock.html)

We ([HugoBar](https://github.com/HugoBar) and [me](https://github.com/Zebiano)) had to create a project for academic purposes that uses THREE.js. So we came up with this idea of having a little room with most of the things we've been taught:

- PointerLock Controls
- Simple object creating and animation
- Collisions
- Drag and drop
- Projectiles and trajectories (aka bullets)

And our little project contains all this. Just it's not working 100% correctly all the time and we don't really have clue to why this is like that. Either way, we'll keep on trying to fix stuff until we're sick of it!

### Things that aren't working:

- Im trying out githubs own "not working"-type of project page... Let's see how that goes.

# Important info: (Sort of a PointerLock Controls tutorial)

So, I'm currently in the process of writing every little thing that comes to my mind that might help others use PointerLock Controls in THREE.js since there's not that much info on how to use PLC on the internet. In case you are trying to create a project that has one of the above mentioned features, feel free to take a look at our code and to read through this "article"!
